## Equisetum classification

### Dataset
Please download our Equisetum dataset [here](). Put **Images** and **Annotations** under the **Equisetum** folder.

In our Equisetum dataset, the three json files are used as training, validation and test set, respectively. You can also split the dataset by yourself with `python -m Equisetum_classification_3.Equisetum.split_datasets`.

[Note]: Before running any code in the repo, make sure that you change parameter `code_dir` in **config.py** to your own repo directory.

### Node detection
1. We use SSD to detect nodes from Equisetum images.  
paperï¼š[SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf).  
The official and original Caffe code can be found [here](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd).  
We use a pytorch implementation for SSD as our base model, and the original repo is [here](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch).

2. Change the code directory in **config**.

3. A pretrained node detection model can be found [here](). Put the detection model under **node_detection/weights/Equisetum** folder. To train the model from scratch, run `python -m Equisetum_classification_3.node_detection.train`.

4. You can use the model to predict nodes for test images by **python -m Equisetum_classification_3.node_detection.get_predictions**. This file should generate a json file stored in **node_detection/results/predictions** containing all the detected bounding box for each image in the test set. 

5. With **visualization.py**, you can visualize the prediction result by having the predicted bounding box on original image. The result si outputed to **results/visualization**.
